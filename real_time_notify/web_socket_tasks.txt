Here are some tasks to get hands-on experience with WebSockets in Laravel:

### 1. **Real-Time Notifications**

   **Goal:** Send a real-time notification to users when an event occurs, such as a new message, order status update, or post like.

   - **Steps:**
     1. Install the Laravel WebSockets package and configure broadcasting with Pusher or a local WebSocket server.
     2. Create a `NotificationEvent` that will handle the broadcast.
     3. Trigger the event in a controller or service.
     4. On the frontend, listen for the event and display a notification popup.

   **Example Usage:** A notification when a new comment is posted on a user’s post.

### 2. **Real-Time Chat Application**

   **Goal:** Build a simple one-to-one or group chat application that updates in real-time.

   - **Steps:**
     1. Set up Laravel WebSockets.
     2. Create a `MessageSent` event to broadcast chat messages.
     3. Build a simple form in your frontend to submit messages.
     4. On message submission, broadcast the `MessageSent` event and listen for it on other clients.
     5. Display new messages immediately without page refresh.

   **Example Usage:** A chat app where users can message each other and see responses instantly.

### 3. **Live User Count on a Page**

   **Goal:** Show the number of active users currently viewing a particular page in real-time.

   - **Steps:**
     1. Use a `UserJoined` event to broadcast whenever a user visits a specific page.
     2. Use a `UserLeft` event for when they leave the page.
     3. Broadcast these events and listen on the frontend to update the live user count.

   **Example Usage:** Useful for pages like blog articles, where users can see how many others are currently reading.

### 4. **Collaborative Document Editing**

   **Goal:** Allow multiple users to edit a document collaboratively, with each user's changes visible to all others in real-time.

   - **Steps:**
     1. Create an `EditMade` event for broadcasting edit actions.
     2. Trigger the event whenever a user makes a change.
     3. Listen for this event on other users’ clients to update the document view.
     4. Optionally, show active users or highlight changes.

   **Example Usage:** Collaborative note-taking or live document editing.

### 5. **Live Polling/Voting**

   **Goal:** Allow users to participate in a poll or vote in real-time, showing live results as users vote.

   - **Steps:**
     1. Create a `VoteCast` event that includes poll or voting data.
     2. When a user votes, trigger this event and broadcast it to others.
     3. Update the live results on all clients in real-time.

   **Example Usage:** A poll on your website where users see results instantly as others vote.

### 6. **Order Tracking Dashboard**

   **Goal:** Real-time tracking of order status updates for an e-commerce application.

   - **Steps:**
     1. Create an `OrderStatusUpdated` event.
     2. Broadcast this event when an order status changes.
     3. On the frontend, listen for this event and update the order status dynamically.

   **Example Usage:** Users can view their order status (e.g., "Shipped," "In Transit," "Delivered") live without refreshing.

### 7. **Stock Price Ticker**

   **Goal:** Display a live ticker with stock prices that updates every few seconds.

   - **Steps:**
     1. Use a scheduled job or API to fetch stock prices.
     2. Broadcast the prices every few seconds using an `StockPriceUpdated` event.
     3. On the frontend, listen for the event and update the ticker.

   **Example Usage:** Display live stock prices on a finance or trading dashboard.

Each of these tasks will allow you to build progressively more complex WebSocket features in Laravel, giving you a solid foundation in handling real-time data updates.
